# Dogcat Example
The Dogs vs. Cats problem is a standard computer vision problem that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat. Although the problem sounds simple, it was only effectively addressed in the last few years using deep learning convolutional neural networks. While the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification from scratch.


## Getting Started
Clone the repository "https://github.com/salomeyosei/Dogvscat"

The dataset for this project can be downloaded for free from Kaggle website.

Download the dataset by visiting the Dogs vs. Cats Data page and click the “Download All” button.

This will download the 850-megabyte file “dogs-vs-cats.zip” to your workstation.

Unzip the file and you will see train.zip, train1.zip and a .csv file. Unzip the train.zip file.

### Prerequisites
Install the required packages which is available in the requirement.txt file.
